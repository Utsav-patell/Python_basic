"""Here e are providing memory to iq by creating a varibale named iq. 
Now we are assinging a value to iq and thus the binary representation of that value is stored
at that particular memory area.
Now when we call the variable it give us that value from that memory location"""

#  Important Rules and Practice to give variable a name
''' Use snake_case measn firstword_secondword
    Start with lower_case or underscore
    We can use Letters, Number and Underscores
    Names are Case Sensitive
    Don't use keyword as name
    Constants are always written in full Capitl name.
    Eg PI = 3.14

#  Important way to assign values to multiple var
a,b,c = 1,2,3
print(a)
print(b)

# Diff between Expression and Statements
user_age = iq/4

# Here Expression is anything that gives us value
# So iq/4 = expression
# But statement is the whole means user_age = iq/4
